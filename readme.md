## Instructions to Run Code

To run the code, please download all the code files and the DailyDialogue dataset and place them in one directory. In the data folder, there is a thorough explanation of the contents of the dataset as well as train, test and validation splits.
The codes have been written in accordance to the Spyder IDE, so the inputs are given that way. Set the working directory to your dataset, and correct all the paths to the train and test .txt files. 

## Required Extensions

Several python packages are required to run these codes. However, the main ones that need to be installed on your local machine before running the codes are given below. 
1) NLTK - https://pypi.org/project/nltk/
2) Keras - https://pypi.org/project/keras/
3) Matplotlib - https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/

Keras can be replaced with Tensorflow as well but the code is primarily built using the Keras module so the syntax of the model's layers has to be changed if you are using Tensorflow.
