## Instructions to Run Code

To run the code, please download all the code files and the DailyDialogue dataset and place them in one directory. This contains a thorough explanation of the contents of the dataset as well as train, test and validation splits.
The codes have been written in accordance to the Spyder IDE, so the inputs are given that way. Set the working directory to your dataset, and correct all the paths to the train and test .txt files.
